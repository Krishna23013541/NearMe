            Ancient temples, vibrant arts, natural wonders and a bustling culinary scene make Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the southern fringes of the country.
            Located on the Coromandel Coast, this busy metropolis was formerly called Madras.
            Tidal Park is one of the first and largest IT parks in Chennai and is fortunately quite close to Hablis Hotel. 
            The distance between the corporate park and the business hotel is 6.6 km and takes 12 minutes to travel.
